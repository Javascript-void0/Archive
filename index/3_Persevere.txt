Persevere - Barrack Obama SPLIT Persevere... nothing worth-while is easy.\nNo one of achievement has avoided failure- \nsometimes catastrophic failures.\nBut they keep at it, they learn from mistakes.\nThey don't quit. SPLIT https://soundcloud.com/benlionelscott/persevere-best-motivation
Persevere - Joel Osteen SPLIT The key is what we do in our times of pain.\nPain will change us.\nHeartache, loss, disappointment, they don't leave us the same.\nYou can come out bitter, or you can come out better.\nYou can come out defeated, giving up on your dreams,\nor you can come out with a new passion, a new fire,\nexcited about the new opportunities in front of you.\n\nDon't just go through it, grow through it.\nThat difficulty is an opportunity to get stronger, to develop character, to gain new confidence.\nThat pain is not there to stop there, it is there to prepare you, to increase you, to develop you.

Persevere - Les Brown SPLIT You're gonna hit a wall.\nAnd that wall shocked some people.\nThat wall stunned some people.\nThat wall discouraged some people.\nIt's painful hitting that wall.\nBut some people hit that wall and refuse to be denied.\nThis person comes back, anyhow, again, and again, and again.\n\nAnd if you keep on hitting that wall,\nhere's what happens to you.\nThat you will have an incredible breakthrough.\nAnd it's as if the universe says, "Let's help 'em out, come on! \nI admire that kind of tenacity. Let's give her a hand." \nThis person doesn't care about the pain.\nBecause this person knows something;\nThere's no gain, without pain.

Persever - Eric Thomas SPLIT Everybody talks positive about themselves. \nEverybody talks like you a beast. \nYou dress like you a beast.\nBut when it's time to do what bees do you back up.\nYou have an excuse.\nInnovation is reward;\nthey give you a plaque for it, they give you a reward for it.\nBut execution is worshipped.\n\nListen to me.\nThere's no excuse in what will seperate those of you from the rest.\nIt's not what they give you, \nwhat's gonna seperate you and what you do.\n\nListen to me very closely.\nI want you to know,\nthere's only one equation is missing,\nthere's only one thing you cannot purchase,\nthere's only one thing you cannot buy.\nAnd that's what real beasts do.\n\nI ain't smart, \nbut the different between me and most people is:\nYou might be sweeter than me,\nyou might be bigger than me,\nyou might grind- listen to me I don't know,\nyou might have money- \nI don't know where you come from but\n you will not out work me.\n\nEvery single time,\nthis is an opportunity of a life-time\nand i'ma take advantage of it.
